        <h2>About Spider-Man</h2>
        <p>Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, is one of Marvel's most iconic and beloved superheroes. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, Spider-Man made his first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962. What sets Spider-Man apart is his relatability. Unlike many other superheroes, Peter Parker is just an ordinary teenager who, after being bitten by a radioactive spider, gains extraordinary abilities.</p>
        <p>With his newfound powers, Spider-Man swings through the city of New York, fighting crime and protecting its citizens. His agility, strength, and ability to cling to most surfaces make him a formidable force against even the most powerful of villains.</p>
        <p>Spider-Man's iconic suit, featuring a red and blue color scheme and a distinctive web pattern, has become an enduring symbol of heroism. Beyond his physical abilities, Peter Parker's quick wit and sense of humor are key elements of his character, providing levity in even the direst of situations.</p>
        <p>Throughout his comic book history, Spider-Man has faced a rogues' gallery of villains, including the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom, each with their own unique challenges and storylines.</p>
        <p>Spider-Man's enduring popularity has led to numerous adaptations in various forms of media, including movies, animated series, and video games. His character continues to inspire and captivate audiences of all ages around the world.</p>
